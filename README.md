# Multi-Output Study Tool Web App

A responsive web application built with React and Tailwind CSS that enables users to upload a PDF or DOCX file and generate various study aids including flashcards, summaries, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a quiz game. The application is designed with a clean, modern, and pixel-perfect user interface, ensuring usability across devices. It includes a mock backend to simulate real data processing and demonstrate front-end proficiency, with potential for future AI or backend integration.
